# Windows Management MCP Server

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.AhmedLaminou/windows-mcp-server -->

Windows Management MCP Server is a Python-based Model Context Protocol server for local Windows diagnostics, task management, cleanup, hardware inspection, security checks, and administrative workflows.

It exposes **96 tools** over stdio and is designed for local assistants such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code extension hosts, and other MCP-compatible clients.

> Important: This server runs with the privileges of the user account that starts it. Several tools can change system state, delete files, edit the Registry, manage services, install updates, or execute PowerShell. Use the read-only and dry-run tools first, and only enable destructive actions after reviewing the target paths and commands.

## What It Can Do

- Task manager: CPU, GPU, memory, disk usage, top processes, process trees, process details, suspend/resume/kill.
- Storage cleanup: disk usage, largest folders/files, duplicate detection, old files, media discovery, Recycle Bin deletion, temp cleanup.
- Hardware and drivers: GPU details, NVIDIA `nvidia-smi` probes, display configuration, installed drivers, problem devices, driver update candidates.
- Windows security: Defender status/scans, firewall rules, BitLocker, Secure Boot, UAC, Windows Update status.
- System administration: services, startup apps, scheduled tasks, event logs, crash diagnostics, restore points.
- Network diagnostics: interfaces, active sockets, listening ports, firewall correlation, ping latency.
- Developer environment: Python/Node discovery, environment variables, common dev ports.
- Shell helpers: Explorer open/select, screenshots, clipboard, visible windows.
- Peripherals and virtualization: printers, print queues, audio, Bluetooth, WSL, Hyper-V, optional Windows features.

For the complete tool catalog, see [docs/TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md).

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server with PowerShell available.
- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Some tools require Administrator privileges or Windows features/modules that may not be installed on every machine.
- Optional vendor data, such as NVIDIA GPU telemetry, requires vendor tools like `nvidia-smi` on `PATH`.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment and install the package in editable mode:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .
```

This registers the `windows-mcp-server` command in the active environment.

## MCP Client Configuration

For clients that can launch a stdio MCP server, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-management": {
      "command": "windows-mcp-server",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

If the command is not on `PATH`, point directly at the local virtual environment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-management": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\WindowsMCPServer\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "windows_mcp_server.server"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:\\path\\to\\WindowsMCPServer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running Locally

```powershell
windows-mcp-server
```

Or:

```powershell
python -m windows_mcp_server.server
```

The server uses stdio transport and is normally launched by an MCP client rather than run interactively.

## VS Code Extension

The `vscode-extension/` folder contains a small VS Code extension that launches this MCP server from the repo-local virtual environment first, then falls back to a global `windows-mcp-server`.

```powershell
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile
```

Open `vscode-extension/` in VS Code and press `F5` to start an Extension Development Host.

## Safety Model

Tools are intentionally mixed across read-only, safer mutation, and sharp mutation categories.

- Prefer report tools first: `disk_cleanup_report`, `get_security_status`, `get_windows_update_status`, `list_scheduled_tasks`, `get_process_details`.
- Prefer safe deletion: `safe_delete_to_recycle_bin`, `safe_delete_many_to_recycle_bin`, `safe_delete_by_pattern` with `dry_run=true`.
- Treat these as sharp tools: `execute_powershell`, Registry writes/deletes, permanent file deletion, service changes, update installation, process termination, restore point creation.

See [docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md) before exposing this server to an assistant you do not fully trust.

## Development

Compile-check the Python package:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall windows_mcp_server
```

Check the registered tool count:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "from windows_mcp_server.registry import register_all_tools, registered_tools; Dummy=type('Dummy',(),{'tool':lambda self: (lambda f:f)}); register_all_tools(Dummy()); print(len(registered_tools))"
```

Compile the VS Code extension:

```powershell
cd vscode-extension
npm run compile
```
